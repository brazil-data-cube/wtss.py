**W**\ eb **T**\ ime **S**\ eries **S**\ ervice (WTSS) is a lightweight web service for handling time series data from remote sensing imagery. Given a location and a time interval you can retrieve the according time series as a Python list of real values.


In WTSS a coverage is a three dimensional array associate to spatial and temporal reference systems (:numref:`Figure %s <wtss:coverage>`).

    A coverage as a three dimensional array.


WTSS is based on three operations:

- ``list_coverages``: returns the list of all available coverages in the service.

- ``describe_coverage``: returns the metadata of a given coverage.

- ``time_series``: query the database for the list of values for a given location and time interval.
